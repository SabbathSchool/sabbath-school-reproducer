# Lesson 1 - Nature of Man

April 1, 1905

## Questions

1. In whose image was man created? Gen. 1:26, 27.
2. How was man created? What was given him? Gen. 2:7.
3. Was this "breath of life" limited to man alone? Gen. 7:21, 22; Eccl. 3:19.
4. To what was man given free access? Gen. 2:16, 17.
16. In the immortal state, to what will man again have free access? Rev. 2:7; 22:14.

## Notes

1. God did not purpose to perpetuate sin throughout eternity, therefore when man sinned he was shut away from the tree of life. None of the human family has ever passed this cherubim and flaming sword sent to guard the way to the tree of life, so there is not an immortal sinner on earth.

4. The mission of Christ to this earth was to bring life to man, who, by reason of transgression, had been shut away from the tree of life. He offers to become a tree of life to all who will believe. Nothing could more effectually rob the Son of God of His glory than to teach that man possesses by nature an immortal soul, and is capable of an eternal existence independent of faith in a Redeemer. Were this so, the mission of Christ to give life would have been in vain.

# Lesson 2 - The State of the Dead

April 8, 1905

## Questions

1. What question is asked concerning those who are dead? Job 14:10.
2. What answer is given? Verse 12.
3. What did the Lord say would be the result of transgression? Gen. 2:17.
16. When will the righteous be gathered home? John 14:1-3; Matt. 24:31.

## Notes

1. The Lord warned man that the penalty for sin was death. Satan plainly contradicted the word of God by stating that man would not die, but be "as God, knowing good and evil." The doctrine therefore of consciousness in death has its origin wholly from this declaration of Satan in Eden. To make good his statement, "Ye shall not die," he has filled the world with the false idea of an immortal soul which survives the stroke of death, and continues to live separate from the body.

3. At creation, the Lord breathed into the man whom He had made the breath of life. In death the process is reversed. The Lord takes from every living creature that which was given at creation, viz., the breath, and death results. Ps. 104:29. But that which the Lord takes from man at death was not a conscious entity prior to the time man received it; neither is it after death.
